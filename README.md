**Employee Attrition Prediction Model Readme**

---

### Overview:
This repository contains a predictive model aimed at forecasting employee attrition within an organization. Employee attrition, the departure of employees from an organization, can have significant impacts on productivity, morale, and overall business performance. Predictive models like the one presented here can assist HR departments and management in identifying factors contributing to attrition and taking proactive measures to mitigate its effects.

### Data:
The model is built using data provided in the Kaggle dataset titled "Attrition of an Employee." The dataset includes various attributes of employees such as age, gender, job role, monthly income, performance ratings, work environment satisfaction, etc. alongside the target variable indicating whether an employee has left the company or not.

### Model:
The predictive model is based on a Random Forest algorithm, a popular machine learning technique capable of handling both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest leverages the power of ensemble learning by training multiple decision trees on different sub-samples of the dataset and averaging their predictions, which often results in robust and accurate predictions.
